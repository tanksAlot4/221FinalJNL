                 <p>Since it was established in 1847, Syracuse has been a widely renowned city in upstate New York. The Salt City is the site of the New York State Fair, Syracuse University, and the Syracuse Mets, the Triple-A affiliate of the New York Mets.</p>

                <p> It is also home to the state’s biggest shopping mall in New York, Destiny USA. While Destiny is the ninth-largest mall in the United States, it also possesses a criminal history.</p>

   <p>Above are the top areas in Syracuse where the most criminal activity has been reported. In 2023, the location with the highest crime rate was Destiny Mall, the largest shopping center in Syracuse. As with other large plazas, theft,particularly larceny, is a significant concern. While local government plans are in place to address these issues, their effectiveness will only be determined over time.</p>


                    <p>Another major issue impacting the community is personal theft. After larceny, the two most prevalent crimes in Syracuse are burglary and theft, which affect a broad swath of the population.</p>

               <p>"I think that safety is important for people in general. When I come out here, I generally watch my backpack to make sure nothing falls out, or that someone doesn’t try to take my stuff when I'm eating. I take the bus here sometimes to buy a new shirt or see a movie. Normally, I don’t worry about stealing,” said a local commuter from Schenectady, NY, who frequents the mall for shopping and entertainment. While safety may not always be a top concern for him, it’s something he remains mindful of when traveling in public.

                <p>In 2023, approximately 145,000 people called Syracuse, NY home. In response to rising crime rates, NY Governor Hochul has committed $23.5 million in state public safety investments in Syracuse and the surrounding Onondaga County. This funding will be directed to local law enforcement and community organizations, such as the New York Gun Involved Violence Elimination Initiative and Project RISE, which focuses on addressing the needs of neighborhoods suffering from gun violionce. </p>

                <p>Hochul's <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-highlights-235-million-reduce-crime-syracuse-and-onondaga-county">plan</a>, which can be found on her New York State governor site, involves investing "$2 million to 11 community-based organizations in Syracuse."that provide mental health services, crisis intervention, mentoring, and vocational training and employment, financial literacy, and conflict resolution, among other services to youth and families at risk or impacted by violence. This is the second year that Syracuse has received funding through the initiative, which engages with community stakeholders to identify and support smaller, grassroots organizations doing life-changing work that haven’t had the administrative capacity to receive state funding. Project RISE will fund three lead organizations – the Center for Community Alternatives and Hillside Children’s Center ($500,000 each) and On Point for College ($1 million) – that will share that funding with eight smaller organizations: Rise Above Poverty, Image Initiative, Fearless Queens, Project SAVE, Diversify NY, Half Hood Half Holistic, Good Life Youth Foundation and Klink Kids."</p>

                     <p>Recently, the governor responded to the growing concerns about public safety, including a reported rise in cases of coronavirus. The increasing number of cases among young adults has sparked worries about gaps in vaccination coverage, which local health officials are working to address.</p>

              </p> Syracuse's mayor, Ben Walsh, has expressed optimism about these steps and is committed to working with law enforcement, community leaders, and residents to ensure safety for all.</p>

                 <p>Recent arrest data has suggested criminal activity in the Syracuse area is on a downward trend. This illustration, based on research from the City of Syracuse Data Portal, shows that the total number of offenses in the back half of this year shows that Syracuse is going towards a decrease in crime in the past few months. This trend has created a positive environment and assured members of the community feel “assured that things are looking better heading into next year and people can feel safe at home, going out, and their minds.” 
                </p>


                  <p> "While the crime rate has been decreasing in these past few months, there are still substantial risks residents feel must be taken into account to prevent the city “from going back on all the good we’ve come so far on.” This quote is from analyzer Thomas Lin who, when interviewd during a telephone conference, provided his honest advisory that many share in concern of how long the criminal activity downturn will continue.</p>

                     <p> These are good signs, but some are cautious that if permanent efforts aren't, recent progression will have all been for not. Addressing issues such as economic disparity and community policing tactics will be important to sustaining a secure and peaceful Syracuse. </p>
                    <p> In a recent study by Neighborhood Scout, the city has a crime of 42 percent. That means that one out of every 24 people is at risk of becoming a victim. To combat this, citizens must stay vigilant and those with the authority to make effective change must do so in a permanent, lasting manner.</p>
